              This is an assemblage! A grouping of images together.
              Click on "add images" to upload files. Then click on an uploaded image to add a caption, if you wish.
              Then, drag an image to the text box on the left to insert it into the page. You can copy-paste the text around to change the order of the images. You can also write text inbetween the images!
